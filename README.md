Project Name: DeepReef AI

Description: 
DeepReef AI which is a Coral Reef Risk Analyzer is a web-based application that evaluates coral reef health by analyzing environmental stress parameters and coral imagery. The project focuses on identifying bleaching risk caused by rising sea temperatures and prolonged thermal stress, helping users better understand reef vulnerability.
This tool is intended for students, researchers, and environmental enthusiasts who want an accessible way to explore coral reef degradation using modern AI-driven analysis.
